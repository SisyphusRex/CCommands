To get number of elements in array:
  int count;
  int arr[] = {........};
  count = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);

Array of Strings
  char *myStrings[] = {"...", "....", "...", NULL}   <---- NULL is required to get size of array because sizeof(myStrings) is just size of ONE pointer
  int count = 0;
  while (myStrings[count] != NULL) {
    count++;
  }
